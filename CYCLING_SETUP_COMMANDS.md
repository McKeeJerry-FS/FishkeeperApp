# Tank Cycling ML System - Implementation Commands

## Step 1: Create All Required Files

Since VS Code workspace access is limited, please manually create the following files or run this script in your terminal:

###Run this in your terminal from the FishkeeperApp directory:

bash
# Navigate to project
cd "/Users/jerrymckeejr/Desktop/Desktop - Jerry's MacBook Air/FishkeeperApp"

# The complete implementation files are in the Markdowns folder
# Please open the TANK_CYCLING_ML_SYSTEM.md file in your Markdowns folder
# It contains all the code you need to copy

# Quick test to ensure we're in the right place
ls -la Models/Tank.cs


## Step 2: Quick File Creation (Copy/Paste Method)

1. **Open VS Code properly**: File > Open Folder > Select "FishkeeperApp" folder
2. **Create these files** by copying code from the documentation
